      <div class="text-body1 q-mt-lg">
        <p>Hello there! I'm Satbir Singh, founder of MnMoo, and I'm so glad you're here. MnMoo is born from a deep love for singing and a core belief that everyone has the potential to unlock their unique voice and experience the pure joy it brings.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-h5 text-weight-bold q-mb-md">Why MnMoo? The Science Behind the Fun</h2>
        <p>Learning to sing traditionally can feel daunting â€“ lessons can be expensive, scheduling is tricky, and self-consciousness can creep in. I created MnMoo to offer a flexible, affordable, and encouraging alternative.</p>
        <p>We are passionate about leveraging research in vocal science and learning theory. Here's how our approach helps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Power of Play:</strong> Gamification isn't just about fun; it taps into powerful psychological principles. By providing clear goals, rewards, and a sense of accomplishment, we keep you motivated and coming back for more, turning consistent practice into an enjoyable habit. Research shows game-based learning can significantly improve skill acquisition and knowledge retention across various domains.</li>
          <li><strong>Structured Skill Building:</strong> Effective learning, especially for physical skills like singing, requires breaking down complex actions into smaller steps and practicing them consistently. Our interactive lessons provide this structure, guiding you progressively.</li>
          <li><strong>Immediate, Actionable Feedback:</strong> Improving requires knowing what to adjust. Our AI feedback acts like a digital coach, offering instant insights that might be hard to perceive on your own.</li>
        </ul>
